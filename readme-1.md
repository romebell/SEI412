## Schedule

Notes below are organized by topic, but they are unordered. This is because we may at any point swap new material in or switch the order of the units.

Something to know is that some of the lessons here are more historical and haven't been used in at least a couple years. For example, the Ruby lessons and the lessons in unit 1 that delve deeper into the guts of ES5 syntax like prototypal inheritance. We've elected to skip that in favor of teaching OOP during the Python unit.

### Origin of this Gitbook

Due to the changing nature of course delivery format in response to COVID-19, this course is only offered remotely at this time, and the student pool spans multiple campuses. This version of the notes is tailored for the SEI 412, offered remotely through the Atlanta campus. It will be a working set of documents as SEI instructors continually adapt this originally campus-driven curriculum for the new demands of work-from-home life. The idea is to front-load each day with lessons in the morning, leaving the majority of the afternoon for flexibe workshop/lab time to accomodate screen-lecture attention spans and the unique demands that families and individuals face during a global pandemic and social unrest over racial injustice.
