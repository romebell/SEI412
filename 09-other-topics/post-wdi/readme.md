# Post WDI

Class is over... what now?

## Continued Learning

Given the pace of this class, it's impossible to retain 100% of what we covered. Therefore, it's a great idea to review the notes repo. Start at the beginning and you'll notice that concepts that were scary and difficult at first aren't so scary anymore.

If you have the time, reading the entire notes repo and running through the assignments again can be **greatly** beneficial. However, most of you won't have time for that, so another option would be to go back through the assignments and try re-doing some of the ones that were difficult, or ones that you didn't fully complete.

Additionally, it's also impossible to learn everything about web development in general. Luckily, part of the last 12 weeks was learning **how to learn.** Web development, and tech in general, involves learning *constantly.* To facilitate this, we provided a list of different technologies with resources for continued learning. We encourage you to learn more about technologies that interest you, and most importantly, **make something using those technologies.** Committing to Github and making projects beyond tutorials is the surefire way to learn and grow. Also, [don't build a skyscraper](https://github.com/WDI-SEA/dont-build-a-skyscraper).

In order to facilitate **project-based learning** and **concept-based learning**, we will list some potential plans for you to structure your learning. On the next page, we'll provide a list of technologies you can choose from in order to act on these plans.
