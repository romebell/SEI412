#Additonal Topics in React

Two additional concepts that appear frequently in React are the **component life cycle** and the **Flux architecture.**

####Component Life Cycle

There are some additional points in the component life cycle that you may want to take advantage of. Examples include when `props` change, or when we remove a component from the DOM. In order to perform different actions during the life cycle of a component, just define the following functions in the component.

* `componentWillMount` – Fired once **before** the initial component render
* `componentDidMount` – Fires once **after** the initial component render
* `componentWillReceiveProps` – Fires whenever there is a change to `props`
* `componentWillUnmount` – Fires before the component unmounts from the DOM

####Flux

While you can incorporate a server with React through a RESTful API and AJAX (jQuery), generally React is used with a different type of architecture called Flux. Watch the video on the Flux Overview page below to understand some of the benefits behind this highly-scalable architecture.

##Conclusion

React is substantially different from Angular because its main goal is to **render UI based on data.** We can keep track of static data using `props`, and keep track of dynamic data using `state`. By isolating data in `state`, we can keep track of when data is changed and re-render the UI accordingly.

Incorporating React with an API involves nothing special. In fact, you can use jQuery's `.ajax` function to make requests inside a React component, then call `setState` when the data is ready.
