# Databases

Storing large amounts of persistent data is an important aspect of nearly every full-stack web application. Initially, we'll go over relational databases, which are the most widely used type of database. We'll be using SQL, which is the most popular query language for interacting with relational databases.

Later in the course, we'll cover MongoDB, which is a nonrelational database that relies on storing data in JSON-like documents.
