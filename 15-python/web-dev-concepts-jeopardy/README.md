# Programming and Web Development Concepts Jeopardy
So far we've been learning web development with the JavaScript programming
language. We're going to begin learning Python, our second programming
language. We'll see what two programming languages share in common and see
how they're different.

Before we dive into our second language let's spend some time identifying
fundamental concepts we've encountered in our first programming language
and in the variety of web frameworks we've used. The more you're able to
identify these concepts apart from any individual programming language or
framework the easier understanding new programming languages and learning
new frameworks will be.

## Control Flow:
Q: This loop is good at doing something an exact number of times.
A: what is a for loop?

Q: This loop is good at doing something as long as a condition is met.
A: what is a while loop?

A: What is an integer?

Q: Something that's only true or false.
A: What is a boolean?

Q: This datatype is a good way to keep a collection ordered.
A: What is an array?

Q: This datatype would be great to use if you need to store the information
   in a phone book.
A: What is an Object?
A: What is a dictionary?

Q: "foo", "bar", and "baz" are common names for these types of variables.
A: What are metasyntactic variables? (lol, no one will get this)
A: variable names that show the name itself isn't special

# Functions
Q: This is 

# Web Requests
Q: This HTTP verb is used when we're trying to update information.
A: What is "PUT?"

Q: The "T" in HTML stands for this.
A: What is "text?"

Q: The first "T" in HTTP stands for this.
A: What is "text?"

Q: This is what we call something that goes over the network from the client to the server.
A: What is a request?

Q: This is what we call something that goes over the network from the server to the client.
A: What is a response?
