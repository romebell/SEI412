### What is the Raspberry Pi

From [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/faqs/#introduction):

```
"Raspberry Pi is the third best-selling 
computer brand in the world. The Raspberry Pi is a
credit cardâ€“sized computer that plugs into your 
TV or display, and a keyboard and mouse. 
You can use it to learn coding and to build 
electronics projects, and for many of the 
things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, 
word processing, browsing the internet, and playing 
games. It also plays high-definition video. The 
Raspberry Pi is being used by adults and children 
all over the world to learn programming and 
digital making."
```

### What are all these options? What do I buy?

For your first project, it can be nice to buy a kit that includes all the things you need. This pretty much ensures everything is plug-and-play or ready to go. That said, if you want to save a little on cost, buying the constituent pieces and setting them up is still pretty straight-forward!

#### What model are we using?

For the in-class demonstration, we'll be using a `Raspberry Pi 3 B+`.

### How do I set it up?

Follow the steps in the project [here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up). This is for the Raspberry Pi 3 B+. Some of the steps will be skippable if you purchased a kit. Otherwise, make sure you follow all the steps!

### Where is the on/off switch

There isn't one! You just plug it in! ðŸ˜„

That said, if you have purchased a battery pack for making your Raspberry Pi mobile (for example, for making a robot car), then that will likely have an on/off switch.

### What accessories do I need?

There are tons of add-ons you can buy to plug into your Raspberry Pi! Technically you don't *need* any of them, but they can be a ton of fun and enable you to do additional projects or have additional features. Some popular add-ons are listed below:

#### Sense HAT

This is a combo of a bunch of different sensors and also has a color display screen! It was originally developed as part of the [Astro-Pi](https://astro-pi.org/) project! The sensors include:

* Gyroscope
* Accelerometer
* Magnetometer
* Temperature
* Barometric pressure
* Humidity

Potential ideas for Sense HAT projects could include things like building a thermometer, creating a magic 8 ball, simulating rock-paper-scissors, or making a compass!

> Tip: Don't have a Sense HAT, but still want to play around with its features? Use the [online emulator](https://trinket.io/sense-hat) or the built-in emulator on the Raspbian operating system!

#### Camera Module

The Raspberry Pi Camera Module is a camera attachment for your Pi. The [All-Seeing-Pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/the-all-seeing-pi) project will walk you through both the set up of the camera module and creating a portable photo booth that tweets photos!

#### Robotic or Remote-Controlled Car

You can buy kits for setting up a robot or remotely controlled car. If this is of interest to you, [this](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-a-buggy) is a great place to start.

#### What else can I get?!

There are lots of options! [Start here](https://opensource.com/life/16/7/top-10-Raspberry-Pi-boards) for a cool top ten list! It includes display boards, traffic lights, and [remote controls for your home](https://energenie4u.co.uk/index.php/catalogue/product/ENER002-2PI)! Use your imagination and start googling!
