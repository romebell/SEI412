## What is Flask?

Flask describes itself as a microframework. It comes with a small set of
utilities that will help you define routes on a server, and send files
back to a browser.

Flask acts a lot like Express in that it imports lots of little single-use
packages. We describe this as a "microframework." The framework relies on
all of the little packages developers choose to pull in themselves and the
framework just deals with allowing those packages to be used in a server
environment easily.

## Install Flask and Create a Minimal Server

Use your terminal's `pip3` command to install Flask for Python3.

```
pip3 install Flask
```

Now that Flask is install, create a file `server.py` that imports Flask and
configures a simple GET route at the server's root. You'll notice the way
Flask defines routes is very similar to how routes are defined in Express!

It's this simple:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
  return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
  app.run()
```

## Configure Route Variables

Like Express, Flask allows us to bake valuable information into our URL
structure. Embedding information into our URLs allows our web applications
to have beautiful URLs that users can remember easily.

Flask extracts the string in the part of the URL and passes it to the route
function as a parameter. It will automatically keep the value as a string
unless you specify another type, like `int`. If you specify a type Flask runs
the value through what it calls a "convertor". Flask comes with a few
convertors out of the box.

**IMPORTANT:** Flask expects every route to eventually return a String. Look at
the multiply route example. Although it specifies that it accepts two `ints` as
route variables it still must manually convert the mathematical result into a
String before the server sends a response.

| Convertor Name | Description |
| -------        | -----       |
| string         | accepts any text without a slash (the default) |
| int            | accepts integers |
| float          | like int but for floating point values |
| path           | like the default but also accepts slashes |
| any            | matches one of the items provided |
| uuid           | accepts UUID strings |

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
  return "Hello World!"
  
@app.route("/profile/<username>")
def profile(username):
  return "You're viewing {}'s profile.".format(username)
  
@app.route("/r/<subreddit>")
def profile(subreddit):
  return "Welcome to the {} subreddit!".format(subreddit)
  
  
@app.route("/multiply/<int:num1>/<int:num2>")
def multiply(num1, num2):
  result = num1 * num2
  return str(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  app.run()
```

## Serve Static Content

The `app = Flask()` function includes useful parameters to customize how static
content is served. These two parameters define where your static directory is
located, and where that directory is made available as a URL on your server.

* **static_folder** defines the name of the directory containing static content.
* **static_url_path** defines what URL you have to direct your browser to to
  access the static content.
  
* if **static_url_path** is not defined then it defaults to `'static'` and
  an `index.html` in the static directory would be accessible at
  <http://127.0.0.1:5000/static/index.html>
* if **static_url_path** is set to `'public'` then your index page would be
  available at <http://127.0.0.1:5000/public/index.html>
* if **static_url_path** is set to an empty string `''` then your index page
  is available at the server root: <http://127.0.0.1:5000/> (this is most
  likely what you want.)
  
You can serve a simple index.html file that includes a script tag link to Angular
and now you've got a simple server serving an Angular app!
  
Application directory structure:

```
~/Code/my_flask_server/
--server.py
--static/
----index.html
```

**server.py**
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__, static_folder='static', static_url_path='')

if __name__ == "__main__":
  app.run()
```

# Last Remarks

There you go! That's the basics of using Python together with Flask. Remember,
Flask calls itself a "microframework". It tries to do provide developers with
just what they need to create a simple web server and nothing more. It stays
out of the way of making major development decisions for you and relies on
developers creating powerful web servers by choosing their own components to
deal with things like Database management and whatever else you'd need.

Flask adheres to the [Unix Philosphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
where they "strive to do one thing and do it well."

Here's a summary of the Unix Philosophy:

* Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
* Write programs to work together.
* Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

# Microframework vs Monolithic Framework

In contrast, we'll also learn about another Python web framework: Django.
Django is a "monolithic" framework that involves itself in much more in the
configuration and operation of a web server. Whereas Flask makes zero decisions
for you and relies on developers importing lots of Third-party libraries, Django
comes with LOTS of tools in it's box. Django uses it's own template system,
has it's own Object Relation Model (ORM) that it uses to interact with databases
and even includes it's own administrative tools, that are actually really
awesome and allow you to easily build websites where you get an administrative
panel where you can edit entries in your database within the website.

Both frameworks have their advantages. If you're looking to pop something up
quick and light, then use Flask and follow their motto of bringing in
dependencies, "drop by drop." If you're looking to build a site that would
benefit from already-integrated user accounts, and batteries-included
administrative tools, then Django might be a better choice.

Happy developing.
