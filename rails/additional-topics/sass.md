# SASS

## Make CSS easier

As we've been covering Ruby on Rails you may have noticed the files in your `app/assets/stylesheets` ending in a different file extension. Instead of our typical `.css` we get `.scss`!

`.scss` files are part of a larger piece of software called SASS, or **Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets**. SASS is something called a **CSS Preprocessor**.

A preprocessor's job is to take a more advanced syntax of CSS and **PROCESS** it **BEFORE** \( hence "pre" \) it is sent to the client as plain old CSS.

## SASS vs SCSS

So if the software is called SASS, why are we using files ending in SCSS?

SCSS or **Sassy CSS** is just the file type that the SASS framework utilizes.

## Installation

When working with Ruby on Rails, SASS is inherently installed in our Gemfile so there's no need to install anything ourselves.

With Node and other back-end platforms you will typically have to install the SASS package manually.

## Cool Stuff SASS gives us

SASS is basically CSS with actual programming aspects incorporated which makes our lives much easier.

### **Variables** \#\#\#

With SASS we can actually utilize variables in our CSS code. These are typically prefaced with the "$" symbol.

```css
$pad: 2em;
$color-primary: rgb(40, 40, 40);
$color-secondary: rgb(40, 170, 220);

body {
  background-color: $color-primary;
}

h1 {
  color: $color-secondary;
}

.container {
  padding: $pad;
}
```

Which will be processed and converted into CSS like this:

```css
body {
  background-color: #282828;
}

h1 {
  color: #28aadc;
}

.container {
  padding: 2em;
}
```

### **Nesting** \#\#\#

With Nesting in SASS we can declare inherited styles that would normally make us repeat the parent selector

```css
nav {
  text-align: center;

  ul {
    list-style: none;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }

  li {
    display: inline-block;
  }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 5px 10px;
  }
}
```

Which will turn into this CSS:

```css
nav {
  text-align: center;
}

nav ul {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

nav li {
  display: inline-block;
}

nav a {
  display: block;
  padding: 5px 10px;
}
```

### **Extend** \#\#\#

Another useful feature is the ability to extend styles from predefined classes or id's. To do so we'll use the **@extend** keyword.

```css
// columns
.col-1-3 {
  width: 33.33%;
}

.col-2-3 {
  width: 66.66%;
}

// colours
.blue {
  color: rgb(40, 170, 220);
}

// structure
.primary-content {
  @extend .col-2-3;
}

.secondary-content {
  @extend .col-2-3;
}

// text
p.highlight {
  font-size: 3em;
  @extend .blue;
}
```

The resulting CSS:

```css
.col-1-3, .secondary-content {
 width: 33.33%;
}

.col-2-3, .primary-content {
 width: 66.66%;
}

.blue, p.highlight {
 color: #28aadc;
}

p.highlight {
 font-size: 3em;
}
```

### **Import** \#\#\#

A great feature of SASS is the ability to import other stylesheets. This aspect allows us to utilize DRY principles even in our stylesheets!

**\*\*Note!** When you're creating `.scss` files that you know you'll be importing into a main stylesheet be sure to name them starting with and_\* underscore\_\*

e.g: `_navbar.scss`

This will tell the SASS preprocessor to not convert those directly to CSS but instead pull them into a main file and then convert everything there into CSS.

```css
@import 'reset';
@import 'grid';
@import 'text';

body {
}

h1 {
}
```

### **Mixins** \#\#\#

Mixins are an extremely powerful feature of SASS. Basically they allow us to define a function and pass parameters to that function in order to output a result. Typically this can be used to make a shortcut for extraneous CSS rules.

```css
@mixin border-radius($radius) {
  -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
     -moz-border-radius: $radius;
      -ms-border-radius: $radius;
          border-radius: $radius;
}

.box {
  @include border-radius(10px);
}
```

And the CSS that comes from that:

```css
.box {
  -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
  -moz-border-radius: 10px;
  -ms-border-radius: 10px;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

## Fin

As we can see SASS gives us many tools that make writing styles for our apps easier and more robust. Basically anything that can improve on CSS we should be all for!
