# Websockets with socket.io

##Objectives

* Describe what realtime means, and how channels & open sockets push data to clients
* Set up websockets on the server side
* Use jQuery to update the client side

###Getting Started

**NOTE: There are two options for this lesson**

1. Access the starter code for the codealong here: https://github.com/WDI-SEA/socket-io-starter
2. Follow the Socket.io chat example, which illustrates sending and receiving messages on both the client and server: http://socket.io/get-started/chat/

## Web basics recap

Let's take it back and talk about how the web works. In very simple terms: you have a client - a program that can make requests to the web - and a server - a computer somewhere that holds information/code. When you want some information, your browser sends a request to get some data and then the server responds. This can be with a GET request or an AJAX request, but in essence, the client is always saying "give me some data".

## What are the issues with this?

Well, the client is in 'control' - the server might have updates, but the client doesn't know about them - and the client has to request information it may not be familiar with.

Alas! In comes polling! The client can keep 'polling' the server to see if it has any more data.

## What are the issues with polling?

It's slow! Polling every `n` seconds isn't ideal, and if you poll too often, your bandwidth will go through the roof and slow your application down.

#### Enter Websockets

WebSockets solves all this. It maintains an open connection from Server <-> Client that we can use to 'push' information and get information, constantly, like push notifications on your phone (Gmail through Mail.app example).

Unlike HTTP requests, once a connection is established with websockets, you don't get continuous meta data like types, user-agents, cookies, dates, etc.

## Installing WebSockets

We're going to add functionality to our application that will pull a constant stream of tweets from Twitter's API. First thing we need is to install the [socket.io](http://socket.io) package.  Jump into the starter code folder and:

```bash
npm install --save socket.io
```

Then, require it in our app with a few changes. First let's add a new require for the _http_ module which gives us the server that socket.io needs to listen to. In `index.js`

```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

// add this
var http = require('http').Server(app);
```

#### What's the difference between app & require('http')

This second way - creating an HTTP server yourself instead of having Express create one for you - is useful if you want to reuse the HTTP server, for example to run socket.io within the same HTTP server instance:

We need change at the bottom from `app` to `server`:

```js
http.listen(port);
```

Also, add to `index.js` below the `http` variable:

```js
var io = require('socket.io')(http);
```

#### Add Twitter Streaming API

Great! We're also going to using another module called [twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) to use with the Twitter Streaming API.

```bash
npm install --save twit
```

And add to your `index.js` at the top:

```js
var Twit = require('twit');
```

##  Setting up our Twitter app

To make any of our apps work with Twitter, we need to declare our app as a Twitter application using apps.twitter.com.

Let's go to [Twitter](https://apps.twitter.com) and create a new 'app':

- **Name:** express-twitter-stream (you'll have to change this to something unique)
- **Description:** Small app to stream tweets from Twitter.
- **Website:** http://127.0.0.1

Then, navigate to **Keys and Access Tokens**, generate **My Access Token**, and copy the keys into a `.env` file like so:

```bash
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=insertkeyhere
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=insertkeyhere
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=insertkeyhere
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=insertkeyhere
```


## Instantiate new Twitter

In JS, we can access environment variables using the following syntax:

```js
process.env.VARIABLE_NAME
```

Create new Twit client in `index.js`:

```js
var twitter = new Twit({
  consumer_key: process.env.TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY,
  consumer_secret: process.env.TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET,
  access_token: process.env.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  access_token_secret: process.env.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
});
```

You can console log this to see if it has worked. Don't forget to run `foreman`!:

```js
console.log(twitter);
```

#### Get Tweets with a websocket

Now we set up our websocket on the server-side. There are a number of reserved words - connect, connection, message, disconnect - that can't be used elsewhere. We want our tweets to stream when we connect to the page so we open a _connect_ channel.

Inside, we set up our tweet socket and finally we _emit_ our _tweet_ on the _tweets_ channel.

```js
io.on('connect', function(socket) {
  var stream = twitter.stream('statuses/filter', { track: 'javascript' });

  stream.on('tweet', function(tweet) {
    socket.emit('tweets', tweet);
  });
});
```

Note that **socket** refers to an individual connection, while **io** refers to all socket connections. Keep this in mind when emitting data.


#### Client Side

Now that's the server side sorted, now let's do the client. Open up our `layout.ejs` and add a few things - jQuery, our socket.io library and an empty JS file:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.js"></script>
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script src="/js/script.js"></script>
```

Notice that the path is relative - that's being done for you by Node.

#### Let's check in Chrome's console

Open up Chrome's console using `cmd+alt+j`

```
> io
< function lookup(uri,opts){if(typeof uri=="object"){opts=uri;uri=undefined}opts=opts||{};var parsed=url(uri);var source=parsed.source;var id=parsed.id;var io;if(opts.forceNew||opts["force new connection"]||false===opts.multiplex){debug("ignoring socket cache for %s",source);io=Manager(source,opts)}else{if(!cache[id]){debug("new io instance for %s",source);cache[id]=Manager(source,opts)}io=cache[id]}return io.socket(parsed.path)}
```

Then in `script.js`, add in our receiving code:

```js
var socket = io();

socket.on('connect', function() {
  console.log('Connected!');
});

$(function() {
  socket.on('tweets', function(tweet) {
    console.log(tweet);
  });
});
```

Notice there's no URL provided to io(), since it defaults to trying to connect to the host that serves the page.

We use one of the reserved events ('connect') to log out the fact we are connected, and then, we hook up to the _tweets_ channel and start logging out what is received.

This is great! We now have own tweets streaming but only to the console. Let's get it on the page with some jQuery.

#### Back to the server-side

Go back to our `index.js` and tidy up the tweet data we're sending through:

```js
io.on('connect', function(socket) {
  stream.on('tweet', function(tweet) {
    var data = {};
    data.name = tweet.user.name;
    data.screen_name = tweet.user.screen_name;
    data.text = tweet.text;
    data.user_profile_image = tweet.user.profile_image_url;
    socket.emit('tweets', data);
  });
});
```

Note the change to: `socket.emit('tweets', data);`

#### Let's change the views

Add a container in `index.ejs`:

```html
<div id="tweet-container"></div>
```

Render the tweets with jQuery and amend `script.js`:

```js
var socket = io();

socket.on('connect', function() {
  console.log('Connected!');
});

$(function() {
  socket.on('tweets', function(tweet) {
    var $tweetName = $('<h2></h2>').text(tweet.text);
    var $tweetAuthor = $('<p></p>').text(tweet.screen_name);
    var $tweetContainer = $('<div class="well"></div>').append($tweetName).append($tweetAuthor);
    $('#tweet-container').prepend($tweetContainer);
  });
});
```

The Twitter stream should now be working. Try opening up another browser window and see all the browser windows update in real time.
