#Node/Express

Node is a runtime environment for running JavaScript, and it allows us to create applications where both the client and server use JavaScript. Specifically, we'll use a web framework called Express in order to create a secure web server that interacts with a database.

By the end of this unit, we'll have designed a 3-tier application similar to this.
