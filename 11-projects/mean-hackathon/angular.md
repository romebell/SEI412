# Part 2: Angular

## Objectives

* Utilize the API from this morning by making an Angular client
* Create a functioning app with a backend API and frontend MVC client
* Deploy an API server to Heroku

## Continuing from earlier...

Now that you have a MVP for your API, add onto it by creating an Angular app to consume it

* Create an Angular app the utilizes the API you made. Keep in mind the setup you'll need to perform:
  * Creating a folder for static files
  * Serving a single page with all the static files
  * Redirecting endpoints that aren't API endpoints to the single page app
* You must create at least two different frontend routes
  * One can be an About page
* REMINDER: You must deploy to Heroku sometime today \(Hint: [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mongolab\#adding-mongolab-as-a-heroku-add-on](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mongolab#adding-mongolab-as-a-heroku-add-on)\)
