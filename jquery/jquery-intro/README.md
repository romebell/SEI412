# Intro

## Objectives

* Describe jQuery and its purpose as a JavaScript library
* Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using jQuery.
* Practice using jQuery selectors

### What is jQuery?

jQuery is a free, open-source, 3rd-party library that is intended to make front-end development tasks --- particularly those involving DOM selection and manipulation --- easier, faster, and more fun.

### But wait, what do we mean by 'library'?

**A `library`** is a collection of reusable functions that serve a particular purpose. The great thing about libraries is that we're using code that solves common problems, thus avoiding _reinvention of the wheel_.

### Why use it?

* simplifies complex DOM manipulation
* concise, intuitive, readable syntax also
* solves many cross-browser compatibility issues for us
* fun and super helpful jQuery plugins
* well-maintained, issues resolved quickly
* designed for developers to implement complex functionality quickly and easily
* makes css changes and javascript animation very simple

### Cons?

* jQuery is much slower than vanilla javascript in many cases \(it solves so many issues so it runs a LOT of code behind the scenes\)
* constantly evolving, so you need to keep up and understand a lot about how it works in order to be able to resolve any issues you encounter when implementing jQuery
* in conclusion: good for readability, bad for debugging
