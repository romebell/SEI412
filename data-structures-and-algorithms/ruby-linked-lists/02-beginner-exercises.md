## Linked List Beginner Exercises

Here are some problems designed to help you practice manipulating linked lists. Each problem has two lines. The first line shows how the list starts. The second line shows how the linked list should end.

Your job is to write code that manually manipulates the given start list so it ends up like the end list.

* You may create new nodes with `Node.new(data)`
* You may create temporary variables to refer to nodes,

  like `current = root` or `current = root.next`

* You may reassign the `.next` value of any node
* Your solution will be in the format of several small lines of code

  manipulating the list.

Here are some example solutions to get you started.

### Example 1

Add a node to an empty list

```text
root -> nil
root -> 43 -> nil
```

Solution:

```text
root = Node.new 43
```

### Example 2

Add a node at the beginning of the list

```text
root -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> nil
root -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> nil
```

Solution:

```text
node = Node.new 1
node.next = root
root = node
```

### Problem 1

Add a node in the second place

```text
root -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> nil
root -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> nil
```

### Problem 2

Add a node to the end

```text
root -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> nil
root -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> nil
```

### Problem 3

Add a node second to the end

```text
root -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 8 -> nil
root -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> nil
```

### Problem 4

Delete the first node from the list.

```text
root -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> nil
root -> 2 -> 3 -> nil
```

### Problem 5

Delete everything from the list.

```text
root -> 34 -> 45 -> 78
root -> nil
```

### Problem 6

Manually stutter an existing list \(make each item appear twice\)

```text
root -> 23 -> 17 -> 8 -> nil
root -> 23 -> 23 -> 17 -> 17 -> 8 -> 8 -> nil
```

### Problem 7

Manually reverse an existing linked list

```text
root -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> nil
root -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> nil
```

## Iterating Over Linked Lists

Now that you're familiar with manually manipulating linked lists try to write methods that act generally on linked lists.

### Contains

Write a method called `contiains` that accepts a linked list and a value. The method should iterate over the list and return true if the value exists as data at a node in the list, or otherwise return false.

```ruby
def contains(ll, value)

end
```

### Get Second-To-Last

Write a method that returns the second to last node in a list. You can assume the list has at least two element in it, or more. You can not assume you know the size of the list. You must use a while loop to iterate through the entire list and find out if a `.next` property on a node points to `nil` to find the end of the list.

```text
def second_to_last(ll)

end
```
