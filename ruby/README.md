# Ruby

Developed during the 90s in Japan, Ruby is a multi-purpose programming language that has won the hearts of numerous startups and organizations via its associated framework, Rails. You'll find that Ruby differs from JavaScript quite a bit. Ruby provides object-oriented features, as well as clean syntax and semantics. You may also notice that there's usually more than one "right way" to perform tasks in Ruby, due to the philosophy of having clean semantics. This may be confusing initially, but you'll see that we end up getting very clean and readable code.

An example:

```ruby
# traditional for loop

for i in (0...5) do
  puts i
end


# or...

5.times do |i|
  puts i
end
```

Let's get started with Ruby!
