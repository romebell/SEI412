# Intro to Ruby

## Objectives

* Describe the history of the Ruby language
* Identify fundamentals and concepts of the Ruby langauge
* Utilize different primitive types, control structures, and methods in Ruby

## Humble Origins

Ruby is an object-oriented language suitable for writing day to day scripts as well as full-scale applications. Yukihiro Matsumoto, or "Matz", began work on Ruby back in 1993, because he wanted a language that made him productive while being fun to use. Initially popular in Japan, Ruby has been finding its way into the hearts of programmers all over the world.

* Ruby stylistically conforms to the **snake\_case** convention
* The [documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/) is fantastic

## Why JavaScript, then Ruby?

While Ruby is a general purpose language that can be used for many purposes, we'll be applying it to a web development framework called Rails. We learned JavaScript first because it's the only language that runs natively in browsers, and we'll be utilizing some JavaScript for our front-end code, while utilizing Ruby for our back-end code.

You'll also find that while Ruby is a functional language, functions cannot be passed into other functions \(functions are not first-class citizens\). However, its object-oriented capabilities and clean syntax provide different strengths as a language. The widely used Rails framework also provides an opinionated development workflow, which can lead to faster development.

## Comments

In JS, we use line and multiline comments.

```javascript
// here's a line comment

/* And a multiline
   comment
*/
```

In Ruby, multiline comments exist, but we generally use line comments with hashtags, for readability.

```ruby
# here is a line comment

# here is a block
# of comments
# for you to read
```

## Variables

Local variables start with a lowercase letter. No `var` necessary.

```ruby
my_variable = 5
puts my_variable
#=> 5
```

## Constants

Mostly, we're able to change what a variable's holding if we so choose â€“ constants are designed for the opposite. Constants are meant to be placeholders that never change.

```ruby
SOME_CONSTANT = 'donuts'
#=> "donuts"

SOME_CONSTANT = 'awesome'
#=> warning: already initialized constant SOME_CONSTANT
```

Note that if we try to reassign a constant, the reassignment still succeeds! All the constant syntax does is throw an error on reassignment.

## Data Types

### Nothingness

Just as Javascript uses undefined or null, ruby uses `nil`

```ruby
my_bank_account = nil
```

### Booleans

A binary representation: either `true` or `false`

```ruby
is_operating = true
is_broken = false
```

### Numbers

Datatypes used to represent a number

* Fixnum: `23`
* Bignum: `23238923859348534535`
* Float: `23.23`

### Strings

A primative datatype used to represent a string of characters

#### Methods

```ruby
.split
.index
.upcase
.downcase
.sub
.gsub
.capitalize
```

#### Examples

```ruby
person = 'instructor'

person.split('')
#=> ["i", "n", "s", "t", "r", "u", "c", "t", "o", "r"]

person.index('tr')
#=> 3

person.upcase
#=> "INSTRUCTOR"

person.downcase
#=> "instructor"

person.sub('r', 'a')
#=> "instauctor"
# note that only the first character is replaced

person.gsub('r', 'a')
#=> "instauctoa"
# note that all character instances are replaced

person.capitalize
#=> "Instructor"

person.reverse
#=> "rotcurtsni"

person.length
#=> 10
```

## Operators

```ruby
+
-
/
*
** #exponent
% #modulo

+=
-=
*=
/=
**=

==
!=
!
||
&&
```

Note that Ruby has a `===` operator, but no `!==` operator. In fact, the operator means something different in Ruby. We'll touch on this when we get to ranges. You can use the `.equal?` function as an identity operator.

### Arrays

An indexed arrangement of objects

_several ways to create an array_

```ruby
arr = [1,2,3]
#=> [1,2,3]
arr1 = Array.new([4,5,6])
#=> [4,5,6]
arr2 = Array.new(3, true)
#=> [true, true, true]
```

#### Array Methods

```ruby
.sort
.reverse
.concat
.length
.push # (<<)
.shuffle
.shift
.unshift
.slice # (negative indicies or ranges, use ! to "splice")
.first
.last
.delete
.delete_at
.inspect
```

#### Examples

```ruby
numbers = [4, 2, 3, 1]

numbers.sort
# => [1, 2, 3, 4]

numbers.reverse
# => [1, 3, 2, 4]

numbers.concat([5, 6, 7])
# => [4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7]

numbers.length
# => 7

numbers.push(8)
# => [4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8]

numbers << 9
# => [4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

numbers.shuffle
# => output will vary

numbers.shift
# => 4
numbers
# => [2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

numbers.unshift(4)
# => [4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

numbers.slice(0, 2)
# => [4, 2]
numbers
# => [4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

numbers.slice!(0, 2)
# => [4, 2]
numbers
# => [3, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

numbers.first
# => 3

numbers.last
# => 9

numbers << 'a'
# => [3, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "a"]
numbers.delete('a')
# => "a"
numbers
# => [3, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

numbers.delete_at(0)
# => 3
numbers
# => [1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

### Ranges

A set of values with a beginning and an end

```ruby
a_range = (1..10) # includes 10
another_range = (1...10) # not including 10
letters_range = ('a'..'z')
```

_typecasting in action_

```ruby
another_range.to_a
=> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

_Using === to determine if an element is within a range or set_

```ruby
another_range === 3
#=> true
```

### Symbols

An immutable sequence of characters that represents data stored in a specific memory location. Symbols optimize memory and can help programs run faster when performing comparisons or lookups.

```ruby
country = :turkey
food = :turkey

country.object_id == food.object_id
=> true

country = 'turkey'
food = 'turkey'

country.object_id == food.object_id
=> false
```

### Hashes

A hash consists of unindexed key-value pairs. You may construct a hash in either of the following ways. Each will use symbols.

```ruby
dog = {
  :name => 'Hamlet',
  :breed => 'Pug',
  :fav_food => 'pate'
}
cat = {
  name: 'Simba',
  breed: 'American Shorthair',
  fav_food: 'Prosciutto'
}
dog[:name]
=> 'Hamlet'
cat[:fav_food]
=> 'Prosciutto'
```

### Mutator methods !

Mutator methods will not just return a value, but change the object they are called on to that value. Adding ! to certain ruby methods will turn them into their mutator method counterparts.

_How to mutate an array_

```ruby
arr = [7,4,5]
arr.sort #not a mutator method
# => [4,5,7]
arr
# => [7,4,5]

arr = [7,4,5]
arr.sort! #the '!', aka a 'bang' will mutate the object
# => [4,5,7]
arr
# => [4,5,7]
```

### Typecasting

Typecasting is the act of altering an object's datatype

```ruby
.to_i
.to_s
.to_a
.to_f
```

## Code blocks

Sometimes called closures in other languages is a chunk of contained code. Use curly braces, `{ }` for single line blocks and `do ... end` for multiline blocks.

```ruby
# count to 10
10.times { puts "Hello" }

x = 0
until x > 10 do
  puts x
  x += 1
end
```

## String Interpolation

Allows one to inlcude a dynamic variable in a string. String interpolation can only be done on double-quoted strings.

```ruby
team = 'Mariners'
puts "Go #{team}!"
# => "Go Mariners!"
```

## Control flow

* Conditionals

  ```ruby
  if
  elsif
  else
  unless
  ```

* Loops

```ruby
until
while
times
for
```

* Enumerables \(similar to iterators\)

```ruby
each
each_char # for strings
each_index
map
select
reduce
```

### Examples

#### If/Else

```ruby
course = "wdi"
if course == "uxdi"
  puts "Hello, User Experience Designer!"
elsif course == "fewd"
  puts "Hello, Front-End Developer"
elsif course == "wdi"
  puts "Hello, Immersed Student"
else
  puts "Who are you?"
end
```

#### Inline conditional

```ruby
if heroic
  do_something_heroic
end

# is the same as
do_something_heroic if heroic == true

# is the same as
do_something_heroic if heroic
```

#### Loops

```ruby
i = 0
while i < 5 do
  puts "i is " + i.to_s
  i += 1
end

# is the same as
i = 0
until i == 5 do
  puts "i is " + i.to_s
  i += 1
end

# is the same as
5.times do |i|
  puts "i is #{i}"
end

# is the same as
for i in (0...5) do
  puts "i is " + i.to_s
end


# Will print out:
# >i is 0
# >i is 1
# >i is 2
# >i is 3
# >i is 4
```

#### Iterating through Arrays

```ruby
foods = ["carrots", "kale", "beets"]
foods.each do |vegetable|
  puts "i like #{vegetable}"
end

# is the same as
for veg in ["carrots", "kale", "beets"] do
  puts "i like #{veg}"
end

# printing out indices
foods.each_with_index do |vegetable, i|
  puts "i like #{vegetable}, #{i}"
end

# Will _each_ print out:
# >i like carrots
# >i like kale
# >i like beets
```

#### Enumerables

```ruby
foods = ['carrots', 'kale', 'beets']

# map (similar to JS map)
foods.map do |food|
  food * 2
end
# => ["carrotscarrots", "kalekale", "beetsbeets"]


# select (similar to JS filter)
foods.select do |food|
  ['carrots', 'kale'].include?(food)
end
# => ["carrots", "kale"]

# reduce (similar to JS reduce)
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.inject do |a, b|
  a + b
end
# => 10

# reduce with a starting value
numbers.reduce(10) do |a, b|
  a + b
end

# reduce applying an operation/function via a symbol
numbers.reduce(:+)
```

#### Iterating through Hashes

```ruby
car = {wheels: 4, doors: 2, seats: 5}
car.each do |key, num|
  puts "my car has #{num} #{key}"
end

# Will print out:
# my car has 4 wheels
# my car has 2 doors
# my car has 5 seats
```

### Functions

#### In Javascript

* anonymous: `function (param1, [..param2, [...]]){...}`,
* named: `function Name(param1, [..param2, [...]]){...}`
* uses lexical scope
* used as values \(functional programming\)
* require explicit return
* all `params` are optional

### In Ruby

* uses `def`
* does not capture scope
* not used as values
* implicitly returns last evaluation
* optional parameters must be specified

#### Examples

```ruby
def say_hello
  puts "Hello, World!"
end

say_hello()

# is the same as

def say_hello
  puts "Hello, World!"
end

# note missing parentheses
say_hello
```

In Ruby, leaving the `()` off of a function call is acceptable. Since functions can't be passed as values \(i.e., aren't first-class\), Ruby knows that we mean to call the function, so it calls it.

#### Parameters \(Arguments\)

```ruby
def say_hello(friend)
  puts "Hello, #{friend}!"
end

say_hello("Tim")

# is the same as
def say_hello(friend)
  puts "Hello, #{friend}!"
end

# note the lack of parentheses
say_hello "Tim"

# is the same as
def say_hello(friend='Tim')
  puts "Hello, #{friend}!"
end

# note that there are no arguments
say_hello
```

#### Return Values

```ruby
def add(num1, num2)
  return num1 + num2
end

sum = add(2, 3)
puts "2 + 3 = #{sum}"

# is the same as
def add(num1, num2)
  # note the lack of explicit return
  num1 + num2
end

sum = add(2, 3)
puts "2 + 3 = #{sum}"
```

Ruby will automatically return the value of the last evaluated expression. This is called having "implicit returns". You are free to have an explicit return statement, but you don't have to.

### Input / Output

You've already seen how `puts` will output information to the screen. What if we want to accept user input? Let's try `gets`.

```ruby
puts "Enter your name:"
you = gets

puts "Enter a friend's name:"
friend = gets

puts "Hello, #{friend}. #{you} says hi."

# Outputs
# Enter your name:
# Tim
# Enter a friend's name:
# Bob
# Hello, Bob
# . Tim
#  says hi.
```

That almost works as we want, but `gets` is reading in the newline character from when we pressed the Enter key. Generally, when reading user input we want to `chomp` the data. \(See [http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/Tutorial/part\_02/user\_input.html](http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/Tutorial/part_02/user_input.html)\)

```ruby
puts "Enter your name:"
you = gets.chomp

puts "Enter a friend's name:"
friend = gets.chomp

puts "Hello, #{friend}. #{you} says hi."

# Enter your name:
# Tim
# Enter a friend's name:
# Frank
# Hello, Frank. Tim says hi.
```

Much better. Now the unnecessary newlines are removed, thanks to `chomp`.
