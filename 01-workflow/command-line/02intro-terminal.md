## What is the Terminal?

Terminal is a modern version of an 'original' **User Interface** for Unix-based computers. At that time a [Text Terminal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal#Text_terminals) is all you would have seen, no windows, no mouse. Because of this history, it's very powerful but sometimes a little cryptic.

Don't worry though, with a bit of practice you'll be flying around like a pro!

Although they technically mean slightly different things, the following terms are types of Terminal Environment

*  Shell
*  bash ('Bourne-Again shell')
*  Command Line
*  CLI (Command Line Interface)
*  Text Terminal
*  DOS Prompt (on windows machines)
*  SSH (on remote machines)
*  Bourne Shell
*  csh
*  ksh
*  sh
*  [UNIX Shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell)
