#AJAX w/JSON and Local Storage

##Objectives

* Utilize JSON files to separate data from logic
* Use AJAX to load data from JSON files in development and production environments
* Use local storage to store data (semi)-persistently on a user's browser

These additional topics are handy for the following scenarios:

* Loading large amounts of data into JavaScript, as opposed to hardcoding the object.
* Saving your user's state locally in the browser.
