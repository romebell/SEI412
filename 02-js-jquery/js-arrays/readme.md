# Arrays

Unfortunately, strings and numbers are not enough for most programming purposes.
What is needed are collections of data that we can use efficiently, Arrays.

Arrays are great for:

* Storing data
* Enumerating data, i.e. using an index to find them.
* Quickly reordering data

```js
var friends = ['Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly'];
// => ['Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly']
```

Items in an array are stored in sequential order, and indexed starting at `0` and ending at `length - 1`.

```js
// First friend
var firstFriend = friends[0];
// => 'Moe'

// Get the last friend
var lastFriend = friends[2]
// => 'Curly'
```

## Group Exercise

Grab the person next to you. One person, create a variable that equals a comma delimited string with at least four of your favorite foods.

```js
var favorites = "noodles,bread,cheese,filet mignon";
```

Have the second person turn that string into an array, then the first person should ask the second what their third favorite food is.

## Iterating Over Arrays

Often we want to write code that interacts with everything in an array. Let's
say we have a list of numbers representing sub-totals on a receipt.

For a moment, let's assume we have four items on our receipt.
We could "hard-code" a program to manually add up all of the
items:

```js
var subTotals = [2.99, 3.00, 2.75, 14.99];
var total = subTotals[0] + subTotals[1] + subTotals[2] + subTotals[3];
```

We say the above example is "hard-coded" because it's brittle. The code assumes
there's exactly four items in the array. The code would cause an error if there
were less than four items. The code would fail to add anything beyond the first
four items in the list. Instead of hard-coding our program we can use a for loop
to *iterate* over the array and calculate a total no matter how many things are
in the array!

```js
// Make a variable to keep track of the total. Start it at zero.
var total = 0;

// Create a for loop that starts at i = 0, and increments i++
// as long as i is less than the length of the list.
for (var i = 0; i < subTotals.length; i++) {
  // add the subtotal of each item to our total.
  total += subTotals[i];
}
```

Iterating over arrays is very common.

## Self Exercise

Use a for loop to iterate over an array. Calculate the average value of all
numbers in the array. Consider how your code would operate on empty arrays,
arrays with one value, arrays with two values, and arrays of any length.

```js
var a1 = [];
var a2 = [14];
var a3 = [29, 32];
var a4 = [16, 99, -40];
var a5 = [12, 28, 92, 23, 94, 23, 99, 99, 99, 92];
```

## Array Methods

Arrays come with special methods attached to themselves that allow you to perform
common operations.

### Adding and Removing Single Items
* `.push('element')` - add an element to the end of an array
* `.pop()` - remove and return the last element in an array
* `.shift()` - remove an element off the front of the array
* `.unshift(3)` - add an element to the beginning of an array

<script src="//repl.it/embed/EbN8/0.js"></script>

### Reorder an array:

* `.sort()` - sort the elements in an array
* `.reverse()` - reverse the array

<script src="//repl.it/embed/EbMe/0.js"></script>

* `.concat([1, 2])` - concatenate two arrays together
* `.slice(1, 3)` - return a copy of a portion of an array
* `.splice()` - alter an array by adding or removing elements
  * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
* `.join(' ')` - take an array and join the elements together as a string
