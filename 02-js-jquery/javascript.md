#JavaScript

The language of the web, JavaScript is a programming language used for a variety of purposes. We'll begin using it to select and manipulate elements on a webpage, and eventually segue into creating web servers that run JavaScript, on top of Node.js

Also, JavaScript is not Java. The difference is huge. So keep that in mind as you learn JavaScript.
