# AngularJS

AngularJS is a front end MVC framework developed by Google. It's a great framework for creating organized applications that communicate with other APIs.

We'll be going over Angular 1.x, which is still a widely used version of AngularJS. Later, we'll be touching on Angular 2.

**Update: In March 2017, Angular 4 came out \(skipping 3\), which is reportedly backward-compatable with Angular 2. As of mid-2017 GA does not yet have Angular 4 materials.**
