Sometimes we want to refer back to older code or lesson material. Maybe we're working on legacy code or maybe we just feel bad deleting stuff. In any case, this section includes:

## React

Written in 2015 or so. Replaced with newer (2019) React material.

## Angular 

Angular version 1.5 (AngularJS). Discontinued after WDI 13 at the Seattle campus.
