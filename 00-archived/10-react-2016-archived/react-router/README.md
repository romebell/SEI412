# React Router

## Objectives

* Describe the concept of React components
* Identify situations where a view router is needed
* Use `react-router` to create different pages in React
* Configure `react-router` to utilize route parameters

## Intro

In AngularJS, we utilized the Angular UI Router to route between different views. Each route was represented via state, and each state could be associated with a view and controller.

React has a similar router called React Router. However, we need to think in terms of React. Each route in React will be represented via a **component**, which contains state and a view. Therefore, we can use the router to switch between different components.
