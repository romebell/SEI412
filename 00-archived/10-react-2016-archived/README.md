# \(Archived\) ReactJS

![ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png)

AngularJS is an example of a MVC framework, where everything displayed is dependent on data manipulated in a controller. A few years ago at Facebook, the Facebook development team created a framework designed only for the _View_. This resulted in ReactJS, a framework for creating user interfaces \(the view\).

Currently, React is in high demand and often used in tandem with modern/experimental tools such as Webpack, Gulp, and ES6.

**NOTE: GA Seattle is not using most of these materials, and last time we tried \(Spring 2017\) we found that many of the lessons were outdated. Because other GA locations have more updated and complete material, we've chosen not to duplicate efforts. \(If you are a student reading this message, we are happy to provide newer materials upon request\)**
