# Intro to Git

## Objectives

* Define what a version control system does
* Describe why someone would want to use a version control system
* Describe git concepts such as pulls, pushes, merges, commits in layman's terms
* Identify main git commands to manage files
* Distinguish between local and remote repositories
* Distinguish between git and GitHub

## What is GitHub?

History/workflow using version control + the github platform [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O885SvVPn1GW6SBnckDcVN3e533mDa31hQ-Y_QE9vQU/edit?usp=sharing)

## Motivation

Have you ever worked on a paper or any document collaboratively with others?

* What have you noticed?
* What was the workflow like?
* What did work, what didn't?

Now enter software programming. Programming is a highly team based activity. That's why I love programming: A project is always more fun when you've got friends working with you. Sometimes very large teams work on a single project. We as developers need tools that support collaborative working. Enter **Version Control Systems**.
