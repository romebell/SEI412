  "rulers":
  [
    80
  ],
  "tab_size": 2,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
  "scroll_past_end": true
}
```

## Setting up Package Control in Sublime Text

* Open Sublime Text
* Bring up the console
  * Use CTRL + \` on OSX
  * or `View > Show Console`
* Go to [https://packagecontrol.io/installation](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) and paste the appropriate code into your Terminal
  * You should be using Sublime Text 3, so copy the Sublime Text 3 code.
* Restart Sublime

## Install Sublime Packages

* Type `COMMAND + SHIFT + P` to open the Command Palette
  * `CTRL + SHIFT + P` on Linux
* Type `Install Package` and select the first result \(by pressing `ENTER`\)
* Type the package you want to install, and press `ENTER` to begin installation.

### Useful Packages that you should install

* ColorPicker \(pick colors by typing `COMMAND + SHIFT + c`, handy for CSS\)
* Color Highlighter \(visually displays colors for hex/rgb values\)
* EditorConfig \(reads configuration files for your editor\)
* GitGutter \(shows git additions/deletions\)
* Terminal \(launch a terminal window from a folder on the sidebar\)
* BracketHighlighter \(highlight brackets and tabs\)
* Bootstrap 3 Snippets \(tab snippets for Bootstrap 3 elements\)
* EJS \(syntax definition, we'll use this when working with Node\)
* Sass \(syntax definition, we'll use this when working with Rails\)
* Babel \(syntax definition, we'll use this when working with React\)
* JSX \(syntax definition, we'll use this when working with React\)

Feel free to install any others, and we'll install others throughout the course.

**Important Note: It is not recommended that you install anything that auto-formats or "prettifies" your code. These are generally hindersome to beginners for learning basic indentation and often are not built well which ends up causing a lot of errors. Do not use these!**

### Creating a Snippet \(Optional\)

We'll use a lot of snippets when working with Bootstrap, and you can make your own as well.

* Go to `Tools > New Snippet`
* Include the content of your snippet inside `<![CDATA[ ]]>` within the `<content>` element.
* To define how to trigger the snippet, uncomment the `<tabTrigger>` line and type the keyword for your tab trigger.
* To trigger the snippet only on certain files \(for example, only HTML, or only JavaScript\), uncomment the `<scope>` tag and change the scope to the language you need.
