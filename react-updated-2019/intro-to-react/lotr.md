# Lab: LotR

Let's build something small to reinforce what you've learned so far. We're going to practice creating components and passing information into them.

We'll build a simple website that shows title and runtime information about the original Lord of the Rings Trilogy.

Specifically, at the end of this lesson, your solution will look like this: ![Lord of the Rings movie info](https://github.com/TaylorDarneille/notes-1/tree/a13a0ac2fda9db5974a38bd1c5c7463b0a34a1ca/16-react/images/lotr.png)

### Setup

Create a new react app called `lord-of-the-rings`:

```bash
npx create-react-app lord-of-the-rings
cd lord-of-the-rings
npm start
```

#### Um, excuse me, you made a typo

Nope! The command `npx` is a legitimate thing. It's called a package runner. You can read more about it [here on npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx). It enables you to run the command `create-react-app` without globally installing `create-react-app`.

> Note: If you globally installed create-react-app, you don't need the `npx` portion of the above command.

### Create A Simple Movie Component

Open up your `./src` directory in your favorite text editor.

Inside of `./src` folder, create a new React Component file called `Movie.js`.

**src/Movie.js**

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Movie extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      // we'll add JSX here
    )
  }
}

export default Movie
```

or, we could write it as a functional component, like so:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

const Movie = () => {
   return (
     // code goes here!
   )
}

export default Movie
```

Let's add some JSX to the render function so this component will be visible in our application. Let's keep the JSX simple for now, and we'll make it more complex once we're sure it works.

Remember, our goal is to display the movie title and runtime information.

Let's add one `<h1>` for the movie title, and a `<p>` for the runtime. Remember, the JSX of each component in React ultimately must descend from just one parent element. Wrap the `<h1>` and `<p>` in a `<div>`.

The JSX will look like this:

```markup
<div>
  <h1>The Lord of the Rings: A Trilogy</h1>
  <p>4h 37min</p>
</div>
```

Add this JSX to the component so that it's returned from the `render()` method.

**src/Movie.js**

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Movie extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>The Lord of the Rings: A Trilogy</h1>
        <p>4h 37min</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Movie
```

so what does it look like as a functional component? I'm so glad you asked!

```javascript
import React from 'react'

const Movie = () => {
   return (
      <div>
         <h1>The Lord of the Rings: A Trilogy</h1>
         <p>4h 37min</p>
      </div>
   )
}

export default Movie
```

### Viewing the Component

Let's make this component appear on the page. One great thing about using `create-react-app` is it tells us exactly what we need to do to start editing our application. The homepage says, "To get started, edit `src/App.js` and save to reload." Let's do that!

Open `src/App.js`.

Add our `<Movie />` component just after the paragraph. Go back to the app and see if it appears.

### Dealing with Errors

Uh oh. There's an error.

```text
Failed to compile
./src/App.js
  Line 15:  'Movie' is not defined  react/jsx-no-undef
```

`'Movie'` is not defined? Ah.

One does not simply refer to components in React. In our `src/App.js`, we're saying "Display what's returned from the `Movie` component." However - we haven't told `src/Apps.js` where to find the `Movie` component! We must import a component before using it.

Add this import statement with the other imports at the top of the `src/App.js` file.

```text
import Movie from './Movie';
```

Now you should see the page without the error message, and it should have the JSX from the Movie component.

The entire `App.js` should look like this:

**src/App.js**

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import Movie from './Movie';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <p>
            Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
          </p>
          <Movie />
        </header>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

or, if you're following along building a functional component, it will look like:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import Movie from './Movie';

const App = () => {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <p>
            Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
          </p>
          <Movie />
        </header>
      </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

### Passing Information via Properties

We need to make our Movie component accept information so we can use it to display different titles and runtimes. In the `src/App.js` file, add `title`, `hours`, and `minutes` props to the `<Movie>` tag. We'll be able to read the value of these props from inside the component. You can name props pretty much anything you want - but it's good practice to be descriptive!

```javascript
<Movie title="The Fellowship of the Ring" hours="2" minutes="58" />
```

We'll be able to read the value of these props from inside the component. You can name props pretty much anything you want - but it's good practice to be descriptive!

React gathers all of the props we added to the call to `<Movie />` and makes them each available through the `this.props` object. This means that inside the `Movie` component, we can now access the values of props through `this.props.title`, `this.props.hours` and `this.props.minutes`. Remember, we use curly braces `{ }` to display the value of something.

In `src/Movie.js`, change the `<h1>` to display the value of the `title` prop by writing `{this.props.title}`.

**Note: in the event that you're using a functional component, you can omit the word "this" from these notes! Just remember to pass props into your function, like so:**

```javascript
const Movie = (props) => {
```

There was also the `hours` and `minutes` props. Update the JSX to access and display the value of each prop we created.

The `render()` function ends up looking like this:

**src/Movie.js**

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Movie extends Component {
    render() {
        return(
            <div>
                <h1>The Lord of the Rings: {this.props.title}</h1>
                <p>{this.props.hours}h {this.props.minutes}min</p>
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default Movie;
```

or, as functional:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

const Movie = (props) => {
  return(
    <div>
      <h1>The Lord of the Rings: {props.title}</h1>
      <p>{props.hours}h {props.minutes}min</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Movie
```

Refresh the page and make sure everything works correctly.

### Reusing the Component

Once you've got props working for one component, then write two more!

In `src/App.js`, call the `<Movie />` component again with different values for the `title`, `hours` and `minutes` properties. Display information for the complete trilogy! \(If you don't know everything about Lord of the Rings off the top of your head, here it is\).

```markup
<Movie title="The Fellowship of the Ring" hours="2" minutes="58" />
<Movie title="The Two Towers" hours="2" minutes="59" />
<Movie title="The Return of the King" hours="3" minutes="21" />
```

## Solution

When you're finished, review the reflections below.

### Reflecting on Reusability

Components are great because they allow us to compartmentalize code and easily reuse parts we create. We simply set the value of props and the component defines how everything should be displayed.

In this instance, we factored out some redundancy of the movie titles.

* All these movies start with `"Lord of the Rings:"`, so only the unique part is the prop.
* Similarly, we don't have to rewrite the format of the runtime information.

Building and reusing components becomes especially powerful the more complex components become.

* Imagine building a component for video search results inside YouTube.
  * The props list is huge:
    * ton of links
    * time information
    * preview images
    * options to add the result to a playlist
    * and all sorts of other things.

Building one component to rule all them all would save you a lot of time and headaches!
