## GA SEI Graduation Requirements

General Assembly's courses are pass/fail programs. We have certain requirements in order to be considered a `graduate` of the SEI program:

* No more than 3 days absent from class over the duration of the course \(3 tardies equals 1 absence\)
* Successful completion of four assigned projects
* Participating in GAâ€™s mid-course and end-of-course feedback surveys
* Complete 80% of assigned "deliverables"

When you complete our program with passing status, you unlock our alumni perks:

* Support from the Outcomes Team
* Receive a GA Letter of Completion \(via email 1 week after graduation\)
* Credits and discounts for other GA courses \(check with Student Services for details\).
* Access to our Alumni Community
