### GA SEI Graduation Requirements

General Assembly's courses are pass/fail programs. We have certain requirements in order to be considered a `graduate` of the SEI program:

- No more than 3 days absent from class over the duration of the course (3 tardies equals 1 absence)
- Successful completion of four assigned projects
- Participating in GAâ€™s mid-course and end-of-course feedback surveys
- Complete 80% of assigned "deliverables"

When you complete our program with passing status, you unlock our alumni perks:

- Support from the Outcomes Team
- Receive a GA Letter of Completion (via email 1 week after graduation)
- Credits and discounts for other GA courses (check with Student Services for details).
- Access to our Alumni Community
