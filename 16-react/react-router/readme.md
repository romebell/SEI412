# React Router

## Learning Objectives

* Define and Create Single Page Apps (SPAs)
* Understand past browser history mechanics

### Notes

Some of this material is for important historical reference, which in any other industry would be an odd thing to say about a tool that's less than 10 years old! We provide this context so you can better understand why React Router (and other tools that support single page apps) made the choices that they did.

Thus, keep in mind some of the "problems" they describe are likely fixed (like Gmails back button issue). You might never have to deal with that particular issue - lucky you! - but as technology becomes more advanced, problems will become more advanced too, so we like to make sure you have a good foundational understanding of problems that have already been solved.
