* Explain the difference between class-based and hooks-based components
* Use the `useState` hook to access and set state
* Use the `useEffect` hook to handle post-render effects

## What are React Hooks?

So far we have learned about two ways to create React components: function-based and class-based. We know that if we make a component that extends the React.Component class, it will be able to use state, lifecycle hooks, refs - the whole kit and kaboodle. In contrast, a function-based component has access to none of that. It is basically just a render function that draws some JSX.

Over time, React users and Facebook engineers realized that much of this functionality is not needed all the time. Moreover, the ways in which state interacted with the various lifecycle hooks was confusing and hard to reason about which led to a lot of improper usage. The creation of Hooks was largely in response to these issues.

Hooks allow us to write a **function-based component** that can "opt-in" to using the various React features by inclusion of a "hook" for that feature. For example, if we want to have state in our component, we can write a functional component that uses the `useState` hook or if we need some action to occur after the render, what would normally be done with lifecycle hooks, we can use the `useEffect` hook.

It is important to know that hooks **DO NOT** work inside class-based components.

There is a hook for every feature of React but the most common and important ones to learn are `useState` and `useEffect`.

## Are Class-based components obsolete?

No! This is very important - the advent of hooks does not make class-based components obsolete. Existing React code will continue to work even if you never use hooks. But Facebook is urging developers to start developing new apps using hooks as they make your React code cleaner, easier to read and maintain, and easier to reason about. Additionally, your components will not have the overhead of class-based components and will minify more effectively.

## The `useState` hook

The first hook we will learn is the one that allows us to add state to a component. It is called `useState` and it gives us the ability to declare initial state, update it, and access it all from a function-based component.

We can import this hook from the react node module by modifying our standard React import line:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```

Now, the way we use this is different than how we used state in a class-based component. Let's say, for example, that we want to store a simple integer counter in state. This is how we create that variable and the corresponding setter function. This line goes inside the body of our function component:

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

Let's examine this line. The `useState()` function returns two items for us: a named variable which will hold our state value and a function for setting its value. We are free to choose the name of the variable (in this case, `count`) but the setter function must be named `setName` where `Name` is what you chose for the variable name, respecting camelCase. These are unpacked using array destructuring into two identifiers. The value passed into useState() is the initial value of the variable.

Now here are the cool things: the variable holding the value is accessible simply by using its name! You do not need to type out `this.state.count` every time you want to get at the value. Also, the `setCount()` function that it makes for you is always bound to this component. There is no need to bind the method or use arrow functions - it will always work just like this!

### Multiple state values

If we decide that we want another piece of state, we can simply add another `useState` line for the new variable:

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
const [user, setUser] = useState({});
```

This will return another variable for holding the piece of state and another setter function. As before, we can choose the name of our state variable (`user`) and then declare a `setUser` identifier to receive the setter function returned from `useState`.

This approach of using a different state line for each variable is a preferred approach. The only time we might want to take a different approach is if our state values were always updated together at the same time. If this is the case, perhaps it makes more sense to combine the state variables into a single, more complex object that we can update with a single function call instead of two. Use your best judgement.

### Using state

Using one of these state values is as easy as referencing the variable name:

```html
// Use it as a JSX variable
<p>You clicked something {count} times.</p>

// Or use it as a prop for another component
<AwesomeWidget value={count} />
```

### Setting state

To give it a new value, we can call the setter function that React gave us:

```html
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
  Click me
</button>
```

**Note:** It is important to realize, when using hooks, that a value in state will have *only that value* for the total duration of that render cycle. Lifecycle methods could change this behavior but you can rely on a value in state if using hooks. But make sure you notice that when we declare the state variable and setter, we are making them constants which means that nothing can reassign to our state variable. This constant-ness lasts until the next render when React replaces the value.

## The `useEffect` hook

What is an *effect*? React uses this term to refer to "side effects" which is more or less anything outside the normal rendering process. Some common examples include fetching data from an API or other network requests, manually manipulating the DOM, or writing to log files. Previously, these kinds of actions were handled by the various component lifecycle methods so it is accurate to think of `useEffect` as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` combined. That's a big change in the way we think about React components but, as you will see, it makes things easier and organizes our code in better ways.

### The problems with Lifecycle Methods

Over the few years that React has existed the lifecycle methods have become a focal point for problems and pitfalls when troubleshooting components. Originally there were several more methods available in the API but these were soon marked dangerous and were later deprecated. Now there are only three or four commonly used but they still lead to confusion when thinking about React. Here are some of the issues:

* Related code needs to be split over multiple methods. For example, if you start an interval upon mounting, you must clear it on unmounting. Or code that must be run on every update including the initial render also needs to be in two different functions.
* `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` block browser updates. They are synchronous actions and must be completed before the browser can update the screen.
* One given lifecycle method can contain code from several unrelated operations leading to further breakdown in logical organization.

Hooks aims to solve these problems by providing a functional approach to side effects. The reasoning is simplified, the code is asynchronous, and related blocks are kept together.

## Using `useEffect`

There are two types of effects:

1. Those not requiring any cleanup like an API call or DOM manipulation.
2. Those requiring cleanup like an interval or a subscription.

### Effects Without Cleanup

Effects without cleanup are the ones we are the most used to in this course. The most common "effect" we run is the fetching of data from an external API when the component mounts. But we could also do something like change the title of the document, something that is inside the DOM but not really within the scope of any component render.

Let's take a look at how we might write an effect to change the document title. We need to import the `useEffect` function so we'll add that to our existing import line. Then, effects go inside your functional component generally after any state hooks you have:

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function AwesomeWidget() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [user, setUser] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>This is your count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

As you see, we call `useEffect()` and pass in a function to run. This function is our effect and it will run after every render. By using it inside the component, we have full access to our state variables as well and can use them freely.

Just as each render has its own props and state, a render has it own effects as well. Instead of thinking of all the stages in the component lifecycle, just think about an effect as happening *after* one given render. We will get into cleaning up an effect (what would normally be done during `componentWillUnmount`) later.

### Effects With Dependencies

The effect above is very simple and can safely run every time we render a component. However, an API request is often something that we *cannot* do potentially multiple times per second. You definitely do not want to trigger an infinite rendering loop that calls an API that you are paying for! To avoid this, we can give our effects dependencies that will prevent them from running unless a dependency has changed.

Say we have an app that views a user's repos in Github. We will store that user in state and then fetch the user's repo list using axios:

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function Repos() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState({})
  const [repos, setRepos] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get(`/api/${user.githubId}/repos`)
      .then((res) => {
        setRepos(res.data)
      })
  }, [user])

  return (
    <p>Yada yada yada</p>
  )
}
```

Nothing shocking inside the `useEffect` function but we are passing in an additional argument after the function: `[user]`. This is our dependency list and in it we are referencing our state variable `user`. This means that the effect will rely on changes in `user` to know when to run or not. It will always run once when it mounts but will then watch any dependencies in that list on subsequent renders. If it finds that any of them have changed from the last render, it will run the effect. Otherwise, it skips it, saving us time and resources.

This leads us to the question, "What if I don't want it to run past the first time? What if we want it to act like `componentDidMount`?" To achieve that, we simply use an empty dependency list:

```js
  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get(`/api/some/data`)
      .then((res) => {
        setSomeData(res.data)
      })
  }, [])
```

Notice how we are still using the second argument but we have nothing in the array. This will cause it to run once at mounting and then never again. Since it has no dependencies, it will never detect a change and will never run more than the first time.

### Effects With Cleanup

In the older lifecycle method paradigm, whenever we started an asynchronous operation in `componentDidMount` we would need to stop it or clean up after ourselves inside `componentWillUnmount`. This splitting up of logic into different functions leads to code that becomes more difficult to maintain as it grows and is one of the main problems that hooks were intended to solve. The `useEffect` hook gives us an incredibly simple way to deal with this: we return a function from our effect that does our clean-up.

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function IntervalTicker() {
  const [handle, setHandle] = useState(null)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // This line starts an interval and stores the returned handle in state
    setHandle( setInterval(() => console.log('tick'), 1000) )
    // This line returns a function that clears the interval
    return () => {
      clearInterval(handle)
    }
  }, []) // Don't forget the empty dependency list

  return (
    <p>Yada yada yada</p>
  )
}
```

Our cleanup for our interval involves clearing that interval by using the handle in the `clearInterval` function. All we need to do to make this cleanup happen is to *return a function that does that* from our effect. This can be any sort of function, named or anonymous, and it just needs to do the cleanup steps. By returning that function from our effect, we are telling React that this function should be run when this component is unmounted. React will take care of the rest! We do, however, need to remember to pass in an empty dependency list so that we don't start a new interval on literally every render.

## What other Hooks are there?

Here are some of the more popular ones:

* `useContext` - Allows use of the Context API, useful for decoupling state from components
* `useReducer` - Used for more complex state manipulations. Works very similarly to Redux.
* `useRef` - Allows for the use of refs to DOM objects
* `useLayoutEffect` - A synchronous version of useEffect used for reading layout metrics and then re-rendering based on those.

There are a few more and more are being added all the time. You can also create your own custom hooks yourself using `useEffect`!

## Conclusion

Hooks represent an improvement in React code organization and reasonability. You don't have to use them since class-based components still exist and work but Facebook is recommending that you try them out since they lend themselves to a better development experience.
