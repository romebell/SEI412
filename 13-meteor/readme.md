Meteor is a Javascript platform (not a framework) for building full-stack, reactive, real-time web apps. Meteor utilizes many aspects of the MEAN webstack including MongoDB, Node.js, as well as optionally including Angular as a the UI layer.

The main pull for Meteor applications is the ease of use, deployment to multiple devices, the speed of development, and the future-proofing of applications.
