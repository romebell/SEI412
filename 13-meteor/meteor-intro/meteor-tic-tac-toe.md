#Meteor Tic-Tac-Toe

Now that you've learned the basic structure of a Meteor app, it's time to build something a little more interesting than a ToDo app. For this deliverable you must construct a real-time tic-tac-toe game using Meteor.

##Start
Fork and clone this repo: [https://github.com/WDI-SEA/meteor-tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/WDI-SEA/meteor-tic-tac-toe)

##Requirements
* Must have at least 1 collection to facilitate real-time functionality
* Clean UI - Bootstrap
* 2 Player functionality

##Bonus
* Build lobby functionality so that a player can choose to either join a lobby that has an opening or create a new lobby
* Implement AI for 1 player mode
